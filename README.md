How to Play 

Movement: Use the left and right arrow keys to move Pinky horizontally. 

Jump: Press the spacebar to make Pinky jump. 

Falling Off Platform: If you fall off a platform into the abyss, you will respawn at the starting point of the current level. You will not lose a heart/life if this happens☺ 

Shooting: Press the left shift key to shoot flames. Move the mouse cursor to aim where you want to shoot. 

Monsters: Monsters WILL attack if you get in their proximity. Shoot them with a flame projectile, or run away to avoid losing a heart.

Collectibles: Collect all four collectibles in each scene to teleport to the next level. 

Inventory: Collectibles are stored in your inventory, (which is the black backpack looking thing under the heart system). You can click it to open the inventory to see what collectibles you collected in the current scene.(Collectibles collected in one scene will not carry over into the next)

Health Regeneration: For every 5 coins collected, a heart will regenerate if lost, helping Pinky stay alive. Levels 1-3 have 10 coins each (gives 2 heart regens). Boss level 4 has 20 coins each (allows for 4 heart regens).

Teleportation Portals: After all collectibles are collected in a level, go to the new portal(the one you did not spawn out of) to go to the next level. Stand in the portal you spawned out of for 10 seconds to teleport back to the previous level.(Be careful with this if you don't want to replay a level) 

Watch out: Beware of falling clouds!Ride the Clouds: Hop on moving clouds for easier transportation around the map.

Boss Level(Level 4): The boss monster has his own health bar unlike the other monsters. He may be a little more difficult to beat, but with enough flames coming his way, he won't stand a chance. Defeat him and his minions to safely navigate through the level!
